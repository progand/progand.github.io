#### My Role

I was lead frontend-developer on the project. I was responsible for frontend development.

We developed *Singe Page Application* (SPA) first. It was based on **Backbone/jQuery**. SPA contained following pages:

- homepage with search bar
- list of apartments with complex filters
- aparmtent details page with availability calendar
- booking page

Later we added server-side rendering on **Python/Flask** for SEO purposes. We used same Handlebars templates on both server and client.

We widely used **Google Maps API** on the project as well.
