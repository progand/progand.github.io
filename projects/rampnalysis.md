## My Role

I have build dashboard and 2 embeddable widgets on **React**. I used **React** hooks for data fetching most of time. Design was provided in _Figma_. I used **Bootstrap 4** as CSS framework.

Dashboard pages I developed:

- _All coutries_ page includes: supported counties on map and datagrid with search and filtering.
- _All cryptocurrencies_ page includes datagrid with search and sorting.
- _Cryptocurrency_ page includes: **Coingecko** price chart, news about the cryptocyrrency, trading widget and list of providers.
- _Provider_ info page includes: news about the provider, supported counties on map, supported payment options list, supported blockchain networks list, supported cryptocurrencies list.
- Blockchain _network_ page includes: network-related news, list of providers with supported tokens, crypto coverage datagrid with search.
- _News_ page includes: search bar, list of news, and some simple statistics.
- _Search_ page includes: search results with lists of providers, cryptocurrencies and networks.
- _Notifications_ page simply represents data from server.

Embeddable widgets I made:

- _Best crypto assets_ helps to find best provider by payment method, coutry, cryptocurrency and fiat.
- _Trading widget_ allows to find the best deal for crypto exchange operation. User inputs amounts of fiat and crypto, payment method and gets the best rate among all providers.

Features: maps, tables and lists, embeddable widgets.

Technologies: **React**, **Bootstrap 4**, **Google Maps API**.

## About Project

Rampnalysis is a crypto exchange platform where user can compare providers rates and select the best possible price. _Provider_ is a website where user can buy/sell crypto coins. Rampnalysis didn't have payment integration when I worked on it. Platform redirect to provider's website for actual crypto processing.

Rampnalysis provides integration with a number of providers (websites):

- Mercuryo
- Xanpool
- Banxa
- Ramp
- Alchemy Pay
- BTC Direct
- Transak
- Wyre
- Moonpay

Dashboard has maps (**Google Maps**), tables and lists.

Embeddable widgets has forms with validation and sophisticated UI and aimed to be published on 3rd-party websites.
