## My Role

I was lead full-stack developer on the project. I was responsible for web app and mobile app development.

Website was a _Singe Page Application_ (SPA). It was based on **Ember.js** and **jQuery**. SPA contains:

- homepage with search and filters
- itinerary page with trip details
- message center with group and private messages
- multi-step create itinerary page wizard
- user profile

I've added a number of features to the website:

- internationalization
- performance improvements
- business logic features
- usability and animations

Main technical challenge was to deal with The Great Firewall of China. Initially we used AWS S3 for images. But upload/download speed was very slow. So we decided to use a China-based file storage.

RethinkDB was used as a database. Node.js and Express.js was used on backend. Passport.js was used for authentication.

Mobile app was a **NativeScript** app. Mobile app contained bacis functionality of the website:

- list of itineraries (trips)
- itinerary details page
- user profile page
