## My Role

I was responsible for frontend development.
My most complex tasks:

- complex forms including wizards with validation
- lots of charts and data grids
- visual web-page builder
- embeddable widget for customers web-sites

Complex forms were developed using Vuetify components (stepper, form and form input and built-in validations). Vuetify provides powerful components for data grids as well.
Chart were made with Echarts.js
Visual web-page builder we made similar to Shopify using predefined templates and compotents.
Embeddable widget was developed on vanilla JS.

## About Project

KINCHAKU is a cloud service that supports customer management and operational efficiency using digital cards.
KINCHAKU will improve the complicated work done with paper and plastic.

This is a one-stop service from issuance to operation and analysis of “Wallet Pass\*” that can be managed with Apple Wallet and Google Pay, which are standard apps for iOS and Android.
By supporting cashless payments, it is possible to reduce cash register work, grasp customer characteristics from usage history, and use it for promotions that suit each person.
