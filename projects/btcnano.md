## My Role

My client needed help with **Ember.js** web application. I worked on the project for 2 month before release. My main focus was on specific **Ember.js** tasks.

I worked a lot with **websockets**, **D3.js** charts and localization. Also I made a number of CRUD operation, table pagination, form validation, capcha, sharing, etc. As always, many **Ember.js** addons were used where possible.

We finished the app successfully.

## About Project

BTCNano is a crypto dashboard for bitcoin.
