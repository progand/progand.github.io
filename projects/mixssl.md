## My Role

Initially MixSSL used classic blade templates with **jQuery**. I have made numerous layout changes and bugfixes as well as added **Vue** webcomponents to the project. **Vue** provided easy way to build complex component for the website.
Design was provided in Figma. **Bootstrap 4** CSS framework was used on the project.

My contribution:

- Frontend for a certificate signing request (CSR) online generator tool
- Multi-step wizard form for certificate issuing.
- Validation for all forms on website
- Layout changes and bugfixes

Features: datagrid, forms with validation.

Technologies: **Vue**, **Bootstrap 4**, **Laravel**, **jQuery**.
