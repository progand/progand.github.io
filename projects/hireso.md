## My Role

I was the only developer on the project. I was responsible for all technical aspects of the project.

Website was a _full-stack Web application_. It was based on **React** and **Next.js**.

I've created a number of features for the website:

- user registration and authentication
- billing and subscriptions
- custom coupon codes for registration
- image upload
- image search eigher by URL or by uploading an image
- enlarge image
- securing search results
- securing forms with capcha
- synchronizing user data with Mailchimp
- website design implementation
- a number of 3rd party API integrations

Application consisted of the following pages:

- homepage with search and image upload
- search results page with download links and ability to enlarge image
- billing page with ability to change subscription plan or make one-time purchase
- a number of static pages

Main technical challenge was to secure search results for anonymous users.

### Technologies

- **Next.js** was used as a framework.
- **NextAuth.js** was used for authentication.
- **Supabase** was used as a database.
- **Prisma** was used as an ORM.
- **Stripe** was used for billing.
- **Mailchimp** was used for email marketing.
- **DigitalOcean App** platform was used for hosting, and **DigitalOcean Spaces** was used for storing images.
- **Tailwind CSS** was used for styling.

## About Project

HiReso is a simple search engine that allows users to search for images by entering an image URL or uploading image.
Users can enlarge any image they are looking for by clicking on the button in the search results.
